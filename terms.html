						<b>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</b>
					</p>

						<p class="termsSide">
							17.1 <b>Application of this Section 17.</b> This Section 17 shall only apply if your country of residence is outside of the UK and the EU.
						</p>

						<p class="termsSide">
							17.2 <b>Generally.</b> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Burrow in the most expedient and cost effective manner you and Burrow agree that, except as described in Section 17.3, every dispute arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Burrow ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
						</p>

						<p class="termsSide">
							17.3	<b>Exceptions.</b> Despite the provisions of Section 17.2, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, province, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
						</p>

						<p class="termsSide">
							17.4 <b>Arbitrator.</b> Any arbitration between you and Burrow will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (<b>"AAA"</b>) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, <b>"AAA Rules"</b>) as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Burrow. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
						</p>

						<p class="termsSide">
							17.5 <b>Notice of Arbitration; Process.</b> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by email (<b>"Notice of Arbitration"</b>). Burrow’s address for Notice is: Burrow Tech Inc., 55 Rothwell Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3P 1A6, Attention: Office of the General Counsel. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (<b>"Demand"</b>). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Burrow may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Burrow must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Burrow in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Burrow will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.
						</p>

						<p class="termsSide">
							17.6 <b>Fees.</b> If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Burrow will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the County of Winnipeg, Manitoba, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Burrow for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
						</p>

						<p class="termsSide">
							17.7 <b>No Class Actions.</b> YOU AND Burrow AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Burrow agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent, which may be withheld if, for example, we reasonably determine that the potential assignee or transferee is, or is likely to be, a competitor of us, or appears unwilling to or incapable of strictly complying with this Agreement. We may assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision of this Agreement will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this Agreement, or any provision of this Agreement, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. The waiver by us of any provision of the Agreement will not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of the Agreement, nor will any custom or practice which may develop between the parties be construed to waive or to lessen our right to insist upon your performance of all the provisions of the Agreement, or support a claim of detrimental reliance by you. The specification in the Agreement of certain acts or omissions as bases for removing you from any Property shall not be construed as limiting our rights to remove you for any other reason allowed by applicable law. Our acceptance of a partial payment of any fees or other amounts owed to us pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to the full amount due, nor will our acceptance of fees or other amounts owed to us pursuant to this Agreement paid late ever constitute a waiver of our right to terminate this Agreement and remove you from any Property for such habitual late payment. Use of section headers in this Agreement is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Nothing in this Agreement will affect your statutory rights as a consumer. Throughout this Agreement the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”.
